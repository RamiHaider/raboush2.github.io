My personal webpage

After learning HTML / CSS3 through 'freecodecamp.org' I put my skills to the test so as to preserve my skills and knowledge.
Anything you learn online you must preserve it through implementation and practise. 

Aside from that, in no particular order, I decided to code my personal web-page for, interest, enjoyment, being independent in controlling
my own web-page and free of needing to use external resources, wanting to learn the ins and outs of web-development, how to structure
your folders, learning to design, make interactive, the hosting side of things, the icon, basically everything!

So, I structured everything as is traditional I believe in web-pages. This is completely static BTW, and doesn't use any interactivity
from JS - but I'm working on that ATM! Anywho, there is the sites pages, styles, and so forth. 

I used brackets to code this and love it. I think I'll try what everyone else is using now a days, the textEditor thing?

Regarding the code:
- Clearly the front-page has some issues with the flex-box. It seems the flex-box has many nuances and I'm just beginning to figure this out.
- Javascript would be an ideal feature in order to display automatically whether at each point in the website, that if you are in a certain part of the website like 'contact', then the contact button would be highlighted. However, I did that in a sort of cheating way by just making it automatically be colored in using CSS and HTML if you were on that part.
