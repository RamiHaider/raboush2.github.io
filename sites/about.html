    <h3> About Rami Abou-Shamalah</h3>
    <p> Palestinian Descent Born in the United States, Minneapolis, Minnesota, on June 20th, 1994, Moved shortly afterwards to Canada, to reside in London Ontario where I currently live with my family. My family consists of 3 boys and 3 girls.</p>
    
    
    
    <p> I wasn't always the least troublesome kid growing up. In fact, I <strong> was </strong> troublesome. I was kicked out of high-school and jumpled around different high-schools. Finally, I found a home at Wheable Adult School, where I spent 2 years catching up with my 3 years of absent high-school grades. There at Wheable I was mentored by Dr. Nail Ramadan, a physics teacher but more than that. I changed my life around and was being accepted into the Theoretical Physics program at Western University. After my first-year into the program, I was offered into the Honors program at Ottawa for Pure Mathematics. </p>
    

    <p>As of 2019, I am on pace to graduate with a 4-year Bachelors of Science degree from Western University with a major in Geology [Expected June 2020]. Such a degree is being sought to pursue a P. Geo status. Professional Geologist was a final cumulation of hundreds of hours of deliberation as to my career choices. I found it to be the best fit in trying to combine passion, interest, monetary compensation, location, job stress.. and a dozen factors more </p>
    <p> Geology wasn't my first choice on the list. Entering university I hadn't a clue as to what I wanted to do. This confusion was an inversion of the classical "Nothing appeals to me" - for truly, absolutely everything was appealing. That is to say, the study in itself, the knowledge, that was interesting, yet in terms of career prospects, I proclaim those words with the utmost "Nothing appeals to me". </p> 
    
     
 
    <h5> hobbies</h5>
    <p> I like painting fine art using mainly oil painting, but I love finding ways to incorporate acryylic and water-color. I like watching and training in mixed-martial arts. I was awarded my blue-shorts in kickboxing some 4 months ago and am working towards my next promotion. I have also attended a few sparring sessions at Adrenaline. </p>
