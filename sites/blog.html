               <h3> Hey! I am learning to code entirely free of any academic headaches. All from free sources from around the web. Shoutout to <a href="https:freecodecamp.com" alt="This is the freecodecamp website direct link" target="_blank"> FCC - AKA Free Code Camp</a> and people who are putting up quality content on youtube. </h3>
               <h3> This website has many purposes. The top two in equal contention is to firstly gain practical programming experience and implement the knowledge I learnt on this pallet. While at the same time branding and advertising my employable skills like painting, calligraphy, tutoring, and perhaps in the near future, web-development and design</h3>

                <h5> It begins! </h5>
                <p> This is when I first decided to jump right into it. No playing around. My motivation is clear, my goals are oriented properly, and my destination is clear. I wanted to learn programming period. It all begins with the simple, that is, web-development, otherwise known as 'Front-end development' - front-end as the comparison with back-end. The skills needed for front-end development are HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT, in that particular order, and perhaps also an order of difficulty. I began my journey with Free Code Academy, and since then I have been learning by the process of doing websites. Which Is what I am doing now. </p>

                <h5> The Creation of my first Website! </h5>
                
             
                <p> Yep - this is my first attempt at a <a href="/sites/index1.html" target="_blank"> Website </a>. If I had to include the amount of stuff I learned here, it would be LONG! I learned LOTS! BUt I also learned that without backpain from sitting, it is actually pretty fun and interesting to learn. PLus, as is the case with absolutely anything that I am doing, I always want to learn more and am keen to understand the deeper things, what lies behind the machinery and so forth!</p> 
                <p style="font-weight: 700"> P.S. If you want to see some comments I made while making that site, 'inspect element' It's completely open-source! </p>

                 <h4> August 12 - 15th, 2018 </h4>
                 <h5> My <a href="/sites/index2.html" target="_blank">Second Website!</a> </h5>
                 <p> I learned LOTS more - and the amount of things I learned I kept in the comment section of html, so for isntance, I would write loads of comments in the html code itself, but that is what a blog is for! </p>

             <h5> It has been a while.</h5>
             <p> So, life happend and I stepped away from coding for a while. At times 'coding' would pop in for a quick visit in a thought that lasted no more than 4 seconds before residing. Well, this summer my younger brother got an internship in his last year of his computer science degree. That sort of rekindled in me a fire to learn programming oncemore. I think it's been motivated by monetary purposes, which isn't all that bad since I am wanting to market myself more as a person, to be more employable, but also to be more self-sufficient in that I can advertise my skills on my own. But honestly and foremostly, it's about wanting to learn at a deep level, I'm never satisfied merely using anything, but wanting to use understand stand it at its most fundamental and rootest level. And so I'm back.</p>
             <p> I am now learning some more advanced things and strengthening / remembering my html css skills, but also I am.... (drum roll)...... LEARNIGN JAVASCRIPT!</p>

             <h5> Returning Oncemore, and Cont. JavaScript</h5>
             <p> So, life happened oncemore. I stepped away from coding - I'm really quite happy I took on this challenge, though it felt like yesterday, such a positive and good habit. I'll continue to learn Javascript throughout this last semester as I prepare for graduation - My goal is to complete the next 2 certificates before graduation, and work in an entry level software development position upon graduating </p>

           <h4> The Beginning </h4>
           <h5> My first study into creation texts</h5>
           <p> It wasn't long before I became acquainted with the earliest civilization to ever write - that is use words to express thoughts on paper. They did so in narrative form, orally, that is to say, for a long time before they began to write in Cunieform, deciphered by a brilliant British guy, and afterthat we arrive at the first ever cosmogony, Creation text titled: "Enuma Elish". It has many elements that are taken from the Christian bible. </p>
           
           <hr>
           
           <h4> Christianity </h4>
           <h5> THe study and longing to know Christianity </h5>
           <p> My first involvement with christianity wasn't until the age of 2 or three, and such is the nature of someone born into a western country, whose implicit norms, codes of behaviour, are predicated upon christian values. So we are implicitly christian by accepting the norms as truthful and acting them out. So, it wasn't long before I read the text and was completely captivated by it, because it was only making explicit what was implicit, or conscious and aware what was previously acted out only without awareness.</p>
           
           <p> During this time I read the 4 canonical gospels, I began first with John which was awesome, and then moved onto the other 3, the synoptic gospels, which I began writing a manuscript to compile a single document, but realized that perhaps the fact that htey are 4 and not 1 is purposeful, for they each provide a different perpsective, appeal to different audiences, and have different narrative forms and structures.</p>
