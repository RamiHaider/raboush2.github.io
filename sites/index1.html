    <p>Hey there, so this website will be updated as I go alone. I am just learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and will be updating this page as I continue through my progress - continually and accumulating knowledge-  thus this webpage is a reflection of my current knowledge in terms of computer programming and so forth.  </p>

    <p> just seeing something..</p>

<h1> Hello World </h1>
  
    <!--- So this is used for writing code for the coder himself! Pretty cool eh? --->
        
    <!--- So - the tags for the headers, footers, main, video, and so forth, actually help much with search engine optimization - so that is something to consider and use obviously - get in the habit of using.

<!---- '<main>' tag helps search engines identify the main content of your website. COOL --->



    <!--- Adding pictures is pretty simple ---> <p> to add a picture, you need to add a 'src' and an 'alt' attribute, the alt attribute is sort of a secondary backup and is also nice for developers and nice for keeping things clean, also in case of backup the image does not load. So.</p>
    <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="This is a picture of some picture found on FCC">
    
    <p> The website where I spent most of my time? Probably 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://reddit.com"> Reddit! </a>...yep
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <!--- Oh.my.god if only some websites would utilize that more - it would make the biggest difference, how many types I have to right click and 'open in new tab' link just because people don't do this. It is literaly like one word. Strange. Plus, it keeps the people on your website longer in stead of taking them to a brand new link, isn't that like even better for marketers? Jeez Louis. --->
    
    <h6 id="CCCC">Hey you!</h6>
   
    <!--- 'ol' is for ordered list, and 'ul' is for bulleted/ unordered list' with each element in there being li nested within, for exampple.

<ol> I totally love
    <li> Banana
    <li> Trees
</ol>

and so forth. --->
